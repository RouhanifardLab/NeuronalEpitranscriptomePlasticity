# NeuronalEpitranscriptomePlasticity

Here we present the results obtained by probing enzyme-dependent pseudouridylation using direct RNA sequencing to assess neuronal epitranscriptome plasticity.
In this GitHub repository, you will find all the code used for the analysis/generation of figures. Due to the size of the data we're hosting big files on on NIH NCBI SRA under the BioProject accession number XXXXXX. You can find these files also on Dropbox. As our analysis requires the aforementioned files to be executed, we recommend downloading the files from Dropbox and substituting the paths to those on your local machine. 

## Getting Started

The R script can be executed in RStudio.
