# NeuronalEpitranscriptomePlasticity

Here we present the results obtained by probing enzyme-dependent pseudouridylation using direct RNA sequencing to assess neuronal epitranscriptome plasticity.
In this GitHub repository, you will find all the code used for the analysis/generation of figures. Due to the size of the data we're hosting big files on on NIH NCBI SRA under the BioProject accession number [XXXXXX]. You can find the files required to run the R script on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/u4od9iafjt336zeqkiqkl/h?rlkey=egwh2dbvdmve61xo8kj8mpmg1&dl=0). We recommend downloading the files from Dropbox and substituting the paths to those on your local machine. 

## Summary

The Figures.r R script can be executed in RStudio.

The CSV files containing the p-values analysis for psi detection has been generated using [p-Mod ID](https://github.com/RouhanifardLab/PsiNanopore).

The SNR files were generated using the SNR_marginal_likelihood.py script, executable in python.
